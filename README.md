## Obstacles encountered 

- Name of beers were different than beer ID : beer ID depended on other factors than beer name
- All of our numerical data were scores from 1 to 5: Difficulties in establishing meaningful plots
- Complex plots to do: some plots were hard to establish and took longtime

## Lessons learned 

- We learned that it is more important to be able to highlight the incoherencies or mistakes than always replace it. 
- We learned how to maniplate matplotlib and seaborn
- Learned how to deviate from origin plan when the circumstances change

## Deliverables

- code
- Tableau dashboard
- final dataset (clean one)

Katerina and Rachad

## Project Description

The goals of this project is to develop the dashboard in Tableau that represents main insights (KPIs). THe dashboard should reflect the domain and be useful for the decisionb-making.

## Steps Followed 

- Load the data: excel file
- Analyze the data and create a plan for data preparation
- Use python to create function in order to follow the cleaning steps
- Brain storming to develop the system of Key Performance Indicators
- Develop the idea of your dashboard:
- Execute the plots and dashboard

## The widgets: 
- KPIs and information
- How happiness looks on a world map ?
- Top/Bottom 10 countries in happiness : years distribution
- How the different metrics change during the years ? Differential average 
- What is the relation between happiness and other factors ?
- Could money buy happiness ?
- Did COVID-19 affect happiness ? Let's test the sample!
- Selecting a sample of countries  - <Nom de la page>
color = country, size = perception of corruption

## Obstacles encountered 

- We had many null values that we had to replace by the mean by country and dropped the rest
- Complex plots to do: some plots were hard to establish and took longtime

## Lessons learned 

- We learned that it is more important to be able to highlight the incoherencies or mistakes than always replace it. 
- We learned how to manipulate tableau
- Learned how to deviate from origin plan when the circumstances change

## Deliverables

- code python for cleaning the data
- Tableau dashboard
- final dataset (clean one)
- readme with widgets explanation
